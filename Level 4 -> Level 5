This level says that the password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the "inhere" directory.
To enter the "inhere" directory, you need to enter the command "cd inhere".
Upon entering the directory check the files present there by entering the command "ls".
Upon entering the command you will see that there are 10 files present (-file00 -file01 -file02 -file03 -file04 -file05 -file06 -file07 -file08 -file09)
To see the file types enter the command "file -file00 -file01 -file02 -file03 -file04 -fil05 -file06 -file07 -file08 -file08"
Did it work?
I am sure that the answer is NO!
Why?
Because the names of the files start with "-"
Hence we need to alter the code a little bit.
"file ./-file00 ./-file01 ./-file02 ./-file03 ./-file04 ./-fil05 ./-file06 ./-file07 ./-file08 ./-file08" is what we need to write.

"./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data"

This is what you'll see as an output.
Obviously, -file07 is the only "Human-Readable file".
So the required password must be in the -file07
Now open this file by entering the command "cat ./-file.07"
You'll see the password as "koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh"
This can be used to enter Level 5. You just need to enter the command "ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and this password.
