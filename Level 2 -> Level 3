In this level you need you need to find the password from a ASCII text file named "spaces in this filename".
Here also you can't just enter the command "cat spaces in this filename". It will show an error saying no file named spaces and so on.
Here the correct method is to write "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename".
This will open the file and you will be able to get the password for the next level.
The password is "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK"
Write "ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the retrieved password in the terminal to enter Level 3.
