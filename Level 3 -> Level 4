In this level the password is written in a hidden file in the "inhere" directory.
First, you need to enter the "inhere" directory by typing "cd inhere".
In this directory if you enter "ls" command no files or directories will be shown because the file is hidden.
To see the hidden files you need to type "ls .?*"
This will tell you that a file named ".hidden" is present
You can check the format of the file by typing "file .hidden" upon which you'll see that it is an ASCII text file.
You can open this file by typing "cat .hidden" upon which you'll find the password for the next Level.
The password will be "pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB".
For entering Level 4 you need to write "ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" in the terminal and also type the above password when asked.
