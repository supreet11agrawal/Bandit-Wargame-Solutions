This one is slightly complicated.
Firstly we need to go inside the "inhere" directory.
This wil be done by typing "cd inhere".
If you type ls here, you'll see that there are 20 directories here. So finding the file manually will be quite difficult.
Thats why we use "find" command here.
The required file has 3 characteristics-
  1. Human-readable
  2. 1033 bytes in size
  3. Not executable
1st point is a little bit vague. Because it's not mentioned what kind of Human Readable.So we'll keep our focus on later 2 points.
To find a file on this basis this code should be written "find . -size 1033c ! -executable"
This will give you the exact location of the file which is "maybehere07/.file2"
So change the directory to maybehere07 through "cd maybehere07" command.
If you write "ls" command you won't be able to see any file named ".file2"
Why?
Because it might be hidden.
So we see the hidden files by the command "ls .?*"
You will see that there are 3 hidden files present named ".file1 , .file2 , .file3"
.file2 is our required file.
Open it by "cat ./.file2" command.
You will see the password for next level there.
Password is "DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7"
Enter the command "ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to enter 6th level.
Enter the above password when asked to do so.
